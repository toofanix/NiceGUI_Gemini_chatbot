# NiceGUI_Gemma_chatbot
- This repo is a demonstration of using and open-source LLM, and using it locally for creating a chatbot. The chatbot can respond as different personalities (Default, Santa Claus and Funny Scientist).
- `text-generation-webui` is used to serve the Gemma model locally (https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).
- The model was downloaded from HuggingFace.
- `nicegui` was used to create the app with which the user and interact (https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui).
- The `different` personalities for the LLM (personality based specific prompts/instructions) were implemented using jinja.
